# TASK-1:Credit Scoring Model
A Credit Scoring Prediction Model is a machine learning model designed to evaluate the creditworthiness of individuals or businesses by predicting the likelihood that they will default on a loan .
## Key Components of a Credit Scoring Prediction Model:
### Input Features (Predictors): 
These are the variables that the model uses to make predictions. The features typically represent financial and demographic information about the individuals, such as:
Personal Information: Age, Client_id, etc.
Financial History: Income.
Loan Details: Amount requested.
### Target Variable:
The target variable is typically binary (e.g., 1 for default and 0 for non-default). It indicates whether a customer has defaulted on a loan .
## Steps to Build a Credit Scoring Prediction Model
### Data Collection:
Gather historical credit data, including both financial and behavioral data of individuals or businesses.
### Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values: Replace or impute missing data.
Normalization: Scale numerical values (e.g., income, loan amount) to ensure all features are on a similar scale.
### Model Training:
Split the dataset into training and test sets.
Choose an appropriate algorithm (logistic regression, decision tree, SVM, etc.) to train on the historical data.
Train the model on the training set by feeding in the input features and target variable.
### Model Evaluation:
Accuracy: Measure how often the model correctly predicts defaults and non-defaults.
Confusion Matrix: Shows true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
Precision and Recall: Precision measures the accuracy of positive predictions, while recall measures the ability to capture all actual defaults.
F1-Score: Balances precision and recall to give a single performance metric.

# TASK-2:Hand Written Character Recognition
Handwritten Character Recognition (HCR) is a technology used to identify and interpret handwritten text. This process involves the automatic detection of individual characters from images or scanned documents of handwritten text.This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate a handwritten digit recognition model using a neural network. We start by loading and preprocessing the data, then build and train a model, and finally evaluate its performance. Visualization helps us understand how well the model is learning and making predictions.Here's a step-by-step description of the handwritten character recognition project, explained below:
## 1. Import Libraries
We start by importing the necessary libraries: TensorFlow and Keras , Matplotlib, Scikit-learn.
## 2. Load and Inspect Data
We load the MNIST dataset, which contains images of handwritten digits (0-9) along with their labels:
Training Data: This includes images and labels used to teach the model.
Test Data: This is used to evaluate how well the model performs on new, unseen data.
## 3. Visualize a Sample Image
We use Matplotlib to display an image from the training set. This helps us verify that the images are correctly loaded and gives us an idea of what the handwritten digits look like.
## 4. Preprocess Data
Before training the model, we need to preprocess the data:
Normalize: We scale the pixel values of the images to a range between 0 and 1. This helps the model learn more effectively by ensuring that all pixel values are on a similar scale.
## 5. Build the Model
We create a neural network model using the Sequential API: 
Input Layer: Defines the shape of the input images (28x28 pixels).
Flatten Layer: Converts the 2D images into 1D vectors so that they can be processed by the following layers.
Dense Layers: Fully connected layers that perform computations on the data. The first dense layer has 128 neurons and uses the ReLU activation function, which introduces non-linearity. The output layer has 10 neurons (one for each digit) and uses the softmax activation function to produce probabilities for each class.
## 6. Compile the Model
We configure the model for training:
Loss Function: sparse_categorical_crossentropy measures how well the model's predictions match the actual labels. This function is suitable for multi-class classification tasks.
Optimizer: Adam is used to adjust the model’s weights during training to minimize the loss function.
Metrics: We track accuracy to see how well the model is performing.
## 7. Train the Model
We train the model using the training data:
Epochs: The number of times the model will go through the entire training dataset.
Validation Split: We use a portion of the training data for validation to monitor the model's performance on unseen data during training.
## 8. Evaluate the Model
After training, we evaluate the model's performance on the test data:
Predictions: We use the trained model to make predictions on the test set and determine which digit each image most likely represents.
Accuracy Score: We compare the predicted labels with the actual labels to calculate the accuracy of the model.
## 9. Plot Training and Validation Metrics
We visualize the training process:
Loss Plot: Shows how the loss (error) changes over time during training. Helps us see if the model is learning effectively or if there are signs of overfitting.
Accuracy Plot: Displays how the accuracy of the model improves over time. This helps us understand how well the model is performing on both training and validation data.
## 10. Make Predictions and Visualize
We use the trained model to make predictions on specific test images:
Visualize Test Image: We display an image from the test set to see what the model is predicting.
Predict Single Image: We use the model to predict the digit in a specific test image and check if the prediction is correct.

# TASK-3:Disease Prediction from Medical Data
Predicting breast cancer involves a structured approach to collecting, preparing, and analyzing data to build a predictive model. The process includes gathering relevant health data, preprocessing it, building and evaluating a model, and finally deploying it for practical use. Here’s a step-by-step description of the code provided:
## Load and Inspect Data:
Load the dataset from a CSV file and display its contents.Check for any missing values and display their counts.Show the first few rows to understand the initial structure of the data.
## Data Cleaning:
Drop an unnecessary column ('Unnamed: 32') that does not contribute to the analysis.
Convert the categorical diagnosis labels into a binary format where 'M' (Malignant) is encoded as 1 and 'B' (Benign) as 0.
## Data Visualization:
Create a count plot to visualize the distribution of binary diagnosis labels.
Remove the original 'diagnosis' column for further analysis and modeling.
Generate descriptive statistics of the cleaned dataset.
Plot the correlation of features with the binary diagnosis label to understand their relationships.
Create a heatmap to visualize correlations among features.
Generate boxplots for specific features to observe their distributions.
Create a pairplot for selected features to visualize their relationships with the binary diagnosis.
## Feature Preparation:
Separate the features (X) from the target variable (y) and remove non-informative columns like 'id'.
## Modeling and Evaluation:
Split the data into training and test sets.Standardize the feature values for consistent scaling.
## Train several models:
Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Classifier (SVC).
Evaluate the models using accuracy scores and classification reports.
Select the best-performing model (SVC in this case) and compute its confusion matrix.
Plot a heatmap of the confusion matrix to visualize model performance.
Perform cross-validation to assess the model's generalization ability and print the average cross-validation score.
This process encompasses data preparation, visualization, model training, evaluation, and performance assessment to build and validate a predictive model for breast cancer diagnosis.
